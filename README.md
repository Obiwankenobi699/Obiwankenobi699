**Exploring AI, ML, and Web Development across the galaxy.**  

## 👋 About Me
- 🌌 Passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Web Development.  
- 🧠 Currently building a deep learning model for medical X-ray analysis.  
- 🐍 Python and JavaScript are my lightsabers when it comes to coding.  
- 🎧 I often debug better to the beat of lo-fi music.  

## 🚀 Tech & Skills
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} I use **Python** extensively for backend development and data science. My current focus is on deep learning for X-ray image analysis using libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I also build RESTful APIs with FastAPI and Flask. For server-side development, I work with Node.js and TypeScript, ensuring scalable and efficient applications.

:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} On the frontend, I create interactive user interfaces with **React** and modern JavaScript/TypeScript. I style applications using Tailwind CSS and optimize them for performance and accessibility. I’m comfortable with Agile workflows and version control, leveraging Git and GitHub to collaborate on projects.
